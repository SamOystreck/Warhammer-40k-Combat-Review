# Warhammer-40k-Combat-Review
A program designed to analyze Warhammer 40k combat, specifically regarding expected wounds dealt or taken.

Version 1.0 implementation will simply scrape Wahapedia for unit stats and compare simulated and expected combat between two units, however future versions may be develloped to include stratagem use, unit-specific abilities and other game-altering rules that are outside the scope of weapon profiles.
